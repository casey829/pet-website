    <h1>About Husky</h1>
    <p>The Siberian Husky dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their
        blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in
        Siberia.
       <br>
        It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but beware because this athletic,
        intelligent dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents. Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini
        and need a yard with a high fence that goes all the way into the ground to prevent escapes. Giving your Husky
        enough exercise may prove easier said than done; though, it’ll reduce boredom and unwanted behaviors, like
        escape attempts. DogTime recommends this dog bed to give a good night’s sleep to your medium-sized Husky. You
        should also pick up this dog fetch toy to help burn off your pup’s high energy!</p>
